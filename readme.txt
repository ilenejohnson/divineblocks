Gutenberg text block that enables settings for desktop, mobile, and phone on the screen.

== Description ==

Divine Text Block permits a user to change the block settings for tablet and mobile on the screen rather than relying on a
programmer to add these settings to a CSS file. The changes show on the edit screen.

Most Gutenberg blocks only allow the settings for the desktop to be changed. And even if they enables
changes to tablet and phone, these changes do not show on the edit screen.


== Installation ==


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/divineblocks` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
